Applying ACWR to a Football Team Dataset

In the data set, there are daily sessions of a team in an entire season.

The relationship between acute and chronic workload will be used as a strategy to try to limit injuries by avoiding unaccustomed high-load workouts.

In addition, strategies for "return-to-play(post-injury)" will be illustrated so as not to make the mistake of doing heavy loads in the early periods following return from injury.

The UM dataset contains heart rate, Catapult playerload and GPS coordinates. We will focus on scoring player load and calculating the ratio of acute to chronic workload.

Player positions: Goalkeeper(GK), Defender(D), Midfielder(M) and Forward(F).
